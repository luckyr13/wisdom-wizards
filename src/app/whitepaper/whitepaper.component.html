					Everybody loves learning platforms! They are great and works perfect. We don't have anything negative to say about it, indeed we want to invite you to visit some of the other incredible places where you can start learning from the best people in the world: <strong>EdX</strong>, <strong>Coursera</strong>, <strong>Udemy</strong>, <strong>Pluralsight</strong>, and so on ...
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					And if you want to install your own platform to provide online courses you can always trust <strong class="purple-wizard">Moodle</strong>, the best <strong>LMS</strong> in the world.
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					But don't you feel that something is missing here?
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					My brother (<strong>@cripto_dr</strong>) and I are truly passionate about blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is about connecting people. We trust in technology because is backed by humans. You need humans to run computers for mining anyway, right?
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					A lot is going on on the blockchain field. We have seen the rising of Ethereum, we started 2021 with new all-times high for crypto.
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					There is another revolution that is emerging as well. A revolution about how we store and preserve data. More specifically, data generated by people all over the world.
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					We have 3 big players at the present: IPFS, Filecoin and Arweave.
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					On this paper we are going to focus on <strong>Arweave</strong> and the <strong>permaweb</strong>. The quick answer about our choose is because Arweave offers "permanent storage".
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					Yep! There's no trick on it. The blockchain created by Arweave offers the best way to preserve data as long as Internet and networking exists.
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					Filecoin is best suited as an AWS/Azure/Google Cloud replacement, but it's by no means permanent storage. You pay with FIL for the time that you use the service.
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					IPFS is great. It's a decentralized and peer-to-peer file storage system but it doesn't pretend to offer permanent storage. Indeed, the nodes needs to clean their data time to time in order to provide storage for new data. You can bypass this by "pinning" your files and in that way indicate to the nodes that your data must be preserved, but it's not as direct as we would like.
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					So here comes to the rescue Arweave and the permaweb!
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					In Arweave you can upload your files to their blockchain and your file will live forever!. It has a cost, yes, a very cheap fee denominated in the currency of the Arweave chain called "Arweave tokens" or AR.
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					For a very first time we, the humans, have the opportunity to preserve our data forever and in <strong>Wisdom Wizards</strong> we want to help you to preserve your wisdom and knowledge forever.
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					Arweave calls this permanent data, the permaweb. The permaweb connects people over extremely long periods of time.
				</p>
				<h1 class="text-center purple-wizard">
					How it works Wisdom Wizards?
				</h1>
				<p class="text-justify">
					Wisdom Wizards is a LMS. A Learning Management System. We are inspired by the great success of Moodle on the web 2.0 world. We want to upgrade this concept to the Web 3.0 world where decentralized networks does the hard-lifting instead of private services like those offered by BigTech. 
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					Wisdom Wizards is a decentralized application, or a dApp. It uses only standard web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This allows our dapp to be hosted on the permaweb. We use IPFS as well to host our development version.
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					It works like any other online platform. You need to register first! Our biggest difference is that we use Arweave Smart Contracts to store your data.
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					All the data registered in our smart contracts is public. It can be read by anyone in the world because it's public on the Arweave network. 
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					Because of this, we have decided to offer all our courses in our platform FREE by default. But don't worry, this doesn't mean that you can't monetize your courses.
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					One of our biggest PLUS in Wisdom Wizards are our Certificates of Completion. When you create a new course on Wisdom Wizards, you can define a price in AR to offer your students a Wisdom Wizards Certificate.
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					Our Certificates are very special because are hosted on the permaweb. Are unique, generated programmatically, stored permanently on a smart contract and can be shared by your students to prove their proficiency on your courses.
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					In Wisdom Wizards you can do two things:
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					+ Create a course.
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					+ Enroll in a course.
				</p>
				<h1 class="text-center purple-wizard">
					How to monetize?
				</h1>
				<p class="text-justify">
					+ You earn AR by each Certificate of Completion purchased by your students.
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					+ You can earn AR by holding our official PST.
				</p>
				<h1 class="text-center purple-wizard">
					How can I get Wisdom Wizards PST for free?
				</h1>
				<p class="text-justify">
					+ We are going to make an airdrop of our PST tokens to our first 100 teachers that succesfully create a course and reach us by email.
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					+ You can earn free PST from our faucet. In our faucet you will find some challenges that reward you with PST on succeed.
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					+ We are going to make an airdrop special for all the people who contributed to the project from the start (feedback is very important to us).
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					+ If you are an Udemy instructor and you migrate your courses to our platform you can earn PST for free.
				</p>
				<h1 class="text-center purple-wizard">
					Where can I buy Wisdom Wizards PST?
				</h1>
				<p class="text-justify">
